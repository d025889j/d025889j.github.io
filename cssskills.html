            <p id="description">This section shows how CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used in web development to
                specify the html documents style with elements such as page layouts, colours and fonts. In this section
                I designed an identical html document with different images twice, one design is designed for use by
                children aged 7-9 and the other is designed for use by individuals over 16 years of age.</p>

                        <p>This Page was created for ages 7-9 and with that in mind I have used a more humorous banner
                            image, more colours have been used to identify sections of information for each animal type,
                            rounded corners have been used on the boxes to create a more cartoon like appearance,
                            slightly larger font sizes have been used for ease of reading and I have used younger
                            versions or more colourful versions of the animals in the images to reflect a younger
                            approach to the page (using a childrens film favourite clown fish in the fish section and
                            using a brighter coloured lizard image etc.).</p>

                        <p>This Page was created for ages over 16 and so I have designed the page to only have a few
                            colours to imply a more mature theme, boxes have square edges to also reflect a more
                            accurate and precise imagery, older versions of the animals have been used for the majority
                            to imply an older perspective of the information (Dog and Cat and rabbit are adult in age
                            and other animals are less bright etc.) and font sizes of the text is smaller to feel more
                            concise and mature.</p>
