                <p>Hi, my name is Andrew Durnall, but amongst my friends and family i'm known as Andy.</p>
                <p>I am Male, 33 years old and married with two feline dependants. I have an interest in many things
                    ranging from computer gaming, music creation, listening to my favourite songs, the many pets I have
                    had over the years, ancient history and pretty much all things related to nature and animals. </p>
                <p>Recently I decided to change my existing electrical/engineering career path and become a computer
                    programmer, and so this website has been created to display my skills in the field of web
                    development via the use of HTML and CSS as well as introducing myself and listing any other relevant
                    skills I have.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>I have had a lot of hobbies & Interests over the years such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Computer Gaming</strong> – Lots of brilliant memories with my old friends who
                                are far away such as Japan, Holland, America and some i have only met through online
                                gaming.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day trips on my Motorbike</strong> – The Sea Side, Popular Bike Cafes etc, it's
                                nice not to have any distractions and just get lost in the journey without a phone on
                                hands free about work or anything like that.</li>
                            <li><strong>Being a guitarist in several Bands</strong> – And a few varied styles of play
                                ranging from Rock, Pop, 80’s and Electro.</li>
                            <li><strong>Warhammer</strong> – I find it quite relaxing to make and paint the models.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong> – I've made a number of good friends through the
                                years while back playing this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paintball & Airsoft</strong> – Great outdoor exercise and team based activities
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Listening to Music</strong> – All Genres, Mostly While Driving, i often find
                                variation between genres can spark new interests in other ones like a road of discovery.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I have been fortunate enough to meet a great many people while undertaking these leasure
                            activities leading me to develop a large amount of personal growth, especially while
                            managing like minded people within these activities as to attain a more fluent enjoyment and
                            better outcome for everyone concerned.</p>

                        <p>With the experiences I have had while working for myself in an engineering background and
                            also working for others in smaller job titles, I see myself thriving in an environment where
                            my place within a company is respected for the abilities I have and working hard is welcomed
                            by my colleagues and superiors alike. </p>
                        <p>Ideally, I would like to work in a field of which I’m interested, such as the Computer Games
                            Industry, Music app/website related technologies, or a web/app development company who is
                            looking for a person such as myself to help their projects come to life.</p>
